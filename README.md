#### üöÄ How to Run the Project

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/oauth2-security-flow.git
cd oauth2-security-flow
```

#### 2. Build the Application

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

#### 3. Run with Docker

Make sure Docker is installed and running.

```bash
docker build -t oauth2-security-app .
docker run -p 8080:8080 oauth2-security-app
```

The application will be available at: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

#### 4. Deployment with GitHub Actions

This project includes a CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions**, defined in:

```
.github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. On every `push` to the `main` branch, the pipeline is triggered.  
2. The Google Cloud SDK is configured using secrets.  
3. The Docker image is built from the project's `Dockerfile`.  
4. The image is pushed to the **Artifact Registry** (GCP Docker repository).  
5. The app is automatically deployed to **Cloud Run** using the pushed image.
